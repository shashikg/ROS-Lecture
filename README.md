$ sudo apt-get install java-common
$ sudo apt-get install arduino
```
**Install rosserial**
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial ros-kinetic-rosserial-server ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino ros-kinetic-rosserial-python
```
Please replace kinetic with the ROS distribution you are using.
### Verify your installation for ROS
In two seperate terminal window execute these two commands and verify whether a blue window opens up with a turtle in its center or not.

$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
## Setting up your ROS Workspace
Run the following commands in series to setup your workspace.

$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```
Now run this command
```sh
$ gedit ~/.bashrc
```
and add this **source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash** at the end of the .bashrc file.
## Setting up your Arduino IDE
First of all run the following commands one by one. Replace (sketchbook) with your exact location of Arduino IDE sketchbook.
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py (sketchbook)/libraries
```
### Verify for Arduino IDE setup
Open Arduino IDE and check whether you can see **ros_lib** folder inside Examples.
